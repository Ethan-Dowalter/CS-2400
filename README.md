# CS2400 - Introduction to Computer Science 1
These are the notable assignments from CS2400 (Fall 2019)

First real computer science class in my experience (though I had taken a Programming in C course before this, it was extremely basic and not geared toward computer science majors)

This class focused on basic programming principles and ideas using C++
